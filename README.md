# SmartFactory_Messages

The core of the SmartFactory project is communicating between the participants, i.e. receiving and sending messages. By using the MQTT technology, it must be possible to dynamically decide in the callback function which message type is involved in order to correctly interpret the message and store it in the correct memory. For this requirement a library was created which can serialize messages through the design pattern factory. The purpose of this concept is to define all message types and their handling in one place in order to ensure a simple communication process. 

The used desing pattern is the factory. The principle is based on the polymorphism in which virtual functions of the base class are overwritten in the child class. A createfunction refers the message type to the correct specific class to serialize the received message. This principle ensures an easy handling of the different message types and standardizes the handling of messages throughout the SmartFactory project.

## Tools and technologies

The source code is implemented in the programming language C++. In the following, the tools for editing the project are listed.

#### Visual Studio Code
The development environment used is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PlatformIO extension](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html). The development environment can be downloaded for free. For an installation guide look here.  

#### Doxygen
Doxygen was used for documentation of the source code. For using Doxygen in Visual Studio code, the [Doxygen Documentation Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cschlosser.doxdocgen) extension can be used.
 

## Software

#### Factory
The structure of the factory design pattern is simple. It consists of a parent class which has a creatfunction and at least one purely virtual function. In addition, it has several child classes, which overwrite and thus define the purely virtual function of the element class. In the createfunction an object of the child class is dynamically created under condition of a criterion (in our case by the message type), the necessary overwritten functions are executed and finally a pointer with type of the parent class, which points to the dynamically created object, is returned. One of the advantages of the design pattern is its modularity. If a new message type is created in the project, it can easily be defined as a child class and added in the createfunction. This principle makes handling the different message types easy and modular.
[Here](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/factory_method) is a detailed explanation of the design pattern factory.

#### UML
The figure below shows the data model in UML notation. In the factory implemented in SmartFactory, the function "translateJsonToStruct" is the creat function and "parseJSONToStruct" is the virtual function which is overwritten.
